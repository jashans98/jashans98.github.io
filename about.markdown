Hi, I'm Jashan (22). Welcome to my personal site and blog, where you'll find writings about
technology, food, books or whatever else piques my interest and I feel is worth sharing.

### What I do
1. üíª I'm in my fourth year of studying computer science (co-op) at the 
[University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). 
My coursework has been focused
around algorithms and computability theory, but I've also enjoyed pure mathematics (esp. analysis), optimization and
(occasionally) some biology. I'll be graduating this April.
3. üë®‚Äçüç≥ With the coronavirus, my foremost hobby has been indulging in culinary experiments -- with varying degrees of success.
It's been a deeply rewarding journey and I try to learn something new every week. I may start sharing recipes and my personal experiences with learning
how to cook from scratch.
4. üìñ In my remaining time, I enjoy sitting back with a good book. Lately, I've been hooked to 
[Brandon Sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/)'s Cosmere universe, but I also reading nonfiction (particularly science
and psychology).
