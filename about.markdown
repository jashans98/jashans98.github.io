Hi, I'm Jashan (22). Welcome to my personal site and blog, where you'll (eventually) find writings about
food, books, technology or whatever else piques my interest and I feel is worth sharing.

I'm currently working on a detailed guide to UWaterloo's computer science co-op program, including everything from r√©sum√© and interview preparation
to making the most of the undergraduate experience. It's the information I wish I had when I was starting out my degree. Stay tuned.

### What I do
1. üíº I'm currently working as a software engineer intern at [Splunk](https://splunk.com), where I work on
iOS, IoT, backend and architecture design. Previously, I worked with the investment team at [8VC](https://8vc.com),
where I diligenced many B2B SaaS and data companies. I've also had the good fortune of working as an AI researcher
at [Uber's Advanced Technology Group](https://www.uber.com/ca/en/atg/), and an iOS engineer at [Wish](https://wish.com). 
2. üíª I'm in my fourth year of studying computer science (co-op) at the 
[University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). 
My coursework has been focused
around algorithms and computability theory, but I've also enjoyed pure mathematics (esp. analysis), optimization and
(occasionally) some biology.
3. üë®‚Äçüç≥ With the coronavirus, my foremost hobby has been indulging in culinary experiments -- with varying degrees of success.
It's been a deeply rewarding journey and I learn something new every week. I may start sharing recipes and my personal experiences with learning
how to cook from scratch.
4. üìñ In my remaining time, I enjoy sitting back with a good book. Lately, I've been hooked to 
[Brandon Sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/)'s Cosmere universe,
but I also enjoy nonfiction. Some of my favourites are 
[*The Gene*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276428-the-gene), by Siddhartha Mukherjee and
[*Thinking, Fast and Slow*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow), by Daniel Kahneman. I may start writing
book reviews soon.
