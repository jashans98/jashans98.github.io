Hi, I'm Jashan (21). Welcome to my personal site and blog, where you'll (eventually) find writings about
food, books, technology or whatever else piques my interest and I feel is worth sharing.

### What I do
1. 💼 I'm currently interning with the investment team at 
[8VC](https://8vc.com/), 
where I focus primarily on B2B SaaS and enterprise tech. Prior to
this, I did AI research at [Uber ATG](https://www.uber.com/ca/en/atg/), and iOS development at 
[Splunk](https://www.splunk.com) and 
[Wish](https://www.wish.com).
2. 💻 I'm in my fourth year of studying computer science (co-op) at the 
[University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). 
My coursework has been focused
around algorithms and computability theory, but I've also enjoyed pure mathematics (esp. analysis), optimization and
(occasionally) some biology.
3. 👨‍🍳 With the coronavirus, my foremost hobby has been indulging in culinary experiments -- with varying degrees of success.
It's been a deeply rewarding journey and I learn something new every week. Stay tuned for recipes, tips, and advice!
4. 📖 In my remaining time, I enjoy sitting back with a good book. Lately, I've been hooked to 
[Brandon Sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/)'s Cosmere universe,
but I also read a healthy amount of nonfiction. Some of my favourites are 
[*The Gene*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276428-the-gene), by Siddhartha Mukherjee and
[*Thinking, Fast and Slow*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow), by Daniel Kahneman. I may start writing
book reviews soon.
