Hi, I'm Jashan (21). Welcome to my personal site and blog, where you'll (eventually) find writings about
food, books, technology or whatever else piques my interest and I feel is worth sharing.

### What I do
1. 💼 I'm currently interning with the investment team at 8VC, where I focus primarily on B2B SaaS and enterprise tech. Prior to
this, I did AI research at Uber ATG, and iOS development at Splunk and Wish.
2. 💻 I'm in my fourth year of studying computer science at the University of Waterloo. My coursework has been focused
around algorithms and computability theory, but I've also enjoyed pure mathematics (esp. analysis), optimization and
(occasionally) some biology.
3. 👨‍🍳 With the coronavirus, my foremost hobby has been indulging in culinary experiments -- with varying degrees of success.
It's been a deeply rewarding journey and I learn something new every week. Stay tuned for recipes, tips, and advice!
4. 📖 In my remaining time, I enjoy sitting back with a good book. Lately, I've been hooked to Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere universe,
but I also read a healthy amount of nonfiction. Some of my favourites are 
[*The Gene*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27276428-the-gene), by Siddhartha Mukherjee and
[*Thinking, Fast and Slow*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow), by Daniel Kahneman. I may start writing
book reviews soon.
